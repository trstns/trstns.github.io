  Hi Mags,  I don't have any Shelly devices using the Shelly integration in Home
  Assistant any more but from memory the device in Home Assistant should show
  the state of the input/switch of the Shelly device.  I've had a little look at
  the code for the integration on GitHub and it looks like it should show a
  binary sensor for the input, but I'm not able to test it to make sure.
